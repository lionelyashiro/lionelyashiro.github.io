My academic work is broadly at the intersection of applied machine learning and business analytics/intelligence. Topical streams include personalized recommendations, social network analytics, target marketing, PropTech, HR analytics, financial analytics, and distributed data mining with privacy protection. My approach is to address relevant business and managerial problems from machine learning, predictive modeling and other computational data science perspectives. In this vein, my research paradigm encompasses formulating business questions into learning problems, analyzing the theoretical efficacy of the proposed methods, devising machine learning methods and algorithms, and using realistic data for benchmarking evaluations, ablation tests, experiments, and other empirical analyses.
